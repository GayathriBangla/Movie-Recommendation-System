A Web Base user-item Movie Recommendation Engine using Collaborative Filtering.
The recommendation based on the underlying idea that is if two persons both liked certian common movies,then the movies that one person has liked that the other person has not yet watched can be recommended to him.
Collaborative filtering based recommendation engine:
This algorithm at first tries to find similar users based on their activities and preferences (for example, both the users watch same type of movies or movies directed by the same director). Now, between these users(say, A and B) if user A has seen a movie that user B has not seen yet, then that movie gets recommended to user B and vice-versa. In other words, the recommendations get filtered based on the collaboration between similar user’s preferences (thus, the name “Collaborative Filtering”).
